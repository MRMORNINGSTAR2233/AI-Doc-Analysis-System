To Whom It May Concern,

I am writing to express my extreme dissatisfaction with the service I received on March 13th. This is my third attempt to contact your company regarding order #12345, and I have yet to receive any meaningful response.

The situation is URGENT and requires immediate attention. If I do not receive a resolution within 24 hours, I will be forced to escalate this matter to your senior management and consider legal action.

The issues are as follows:
1. Product arrived damaged
2. No response to previous two emails
3. Charged twice for the order

I expect:
- Immediate refund of the duplicate charge
- Replacement of the damaged product
- Written apology for the lack of response
- Compensation for the time wasted

This is completely unacceptable for a company of your reputation. I demand immediate action on this matter.

Regards,
John Smith
