To whom it may concern,

I am writing to express my EXTREME DISSATISFACTION with your cloud service platform. This is the third major outage in two weeks, causing our business significant financial losses exceeding $50,000. This is completely UNACCEPTABLE!

Timeline of Issues:
1. March 1st - 4-hour downtime during peak business hours
2. March 8th - Data synchronization errors affecting customer transactions
3. Today - Complete system failure since 6 AM EST

Our Service Level Agreement (SLA) guarantees 99.9% uptime, which you have consistently failed to maintain. If this issue is not resolved within the next 2 hours, we will be forced to:

1. Initiate legal proceedings for breach of contract
2. File formal complaints with relevant regulatory bodies
3. Seek immediate compensation for business losses
4. Cancel our enterprise subscription ($25,000/month)

I expect:
- Immediate system restoration
- Detailed incident report within 24 hours
- Full compensation for downtime
- Written action plan to prevent future occurrences

Your lack of proactive communication during these incidents is particularly frustrating. Our business operations are completely halted, and we have 250+ employees sitting idle.

If I don't receive a response by 11:15 AM EST today, I will escalate this to your CEO and begin legal proceedings.

Regards,
John Anderson
