Subject: URGENT: Extremely Dissatisfied with Service

To whom it may concern,

I am writing to express my extreme dissatisfaction with your service. This is the third time I've had to contact you about this ongoing issue, and I am beyond frustrated.

I have been a loyal customer for over 5 years, but the level of service I've received in the past month is absolutely unacceptable. My account has been incorrectly charged multiple times, and despite my previous emails, this issue remains unresolved.

If this matter is not addressed within 24 hours, I will be forced to:
1. File a formal complaint with the consumer protection bureau
2. Contact my credit card company to dispute all recent charges
3. Share my experience on social media and review platforms

I expect an immediate response and resolution to this issue. This is your last chance to make this right before I take further action.

Regards,
John Smith
